    <h1>Welcome to the Home page</h1>
    <p>This project is a WIP, the home page is not made yet. Maybe some day it will be beuatifull, probaply not 😉</p>
    <br/>
    <p>At this moment, we only have an <b-button to="/products" variant="primary">Product Page</b-button> </p>
    <br/>
    <p>It is also possible to <b-button to="/Register" variant="primary">Register</b-button> with email and password, but that has no functionality yet in the app.</p>
